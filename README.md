# USB Power Meter PCB (No Programming Required)

## Design a USB inline power meter PCB that measures and displays voltage and current drawn by a USB-powered device using analog components only (no microcontroller or code).

## Tasks
Design Requirements:
	- USB Type-A male and female connectors (acts as a passthrough)
	- Use a shunt resistor + op-amp-based current sensing circuit (e.g., using LM358)
	- Voltage divider to measure USB voltage (5V nominal)
	- Analog voltmeter (e.g., voltmeter module or analog output headers)
	- Optional: include headers for connecting a multimeter for external readings
	- Power Path Protection:
	- Add a PTC fuse and TVS diode for USB safety
	- Add optional toggle switch to disconnect load manually

Design Tasks:
	- Schematic with labeled components
	- 2-layer PCB layout (small, inline device)
	- Create BOM with part numbers
	- Add test points or measurement headers

## Submit: 
Final full package including:
	- Schematic (PDF + editable format)
	- PCB Layout + Gerbers
	- BOM
	- Report explaining how the voltage/current measurement works

## Estimated time: 2 weeks
